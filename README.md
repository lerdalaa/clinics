# clinics

React/Node app with the following functionality:
* A map with pins representing clinics (or stores) pulled from a database, clickable with an info popup
* add clinics by address or by double clicking the map
* filter clinics based on 'tags'
* simple login system, with different views and permissions based on login status

Adding clinic by address is disabled because it was unreliable. Switching from MapBox Geocoder which is 4 years old to Google maps Geocoder. Add clinics by double-clicking the map.
